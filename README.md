# Anonymous Rental Matching Platform

A privacy-preserving decentralized application that enables secure matching between tenants and landlords while protecting the identities of both parties through advanced cryptographic techniques.

## Core Concept

### Anonymous Rental Matching Platform
- **Privacy-Protected Tenant-Landlord Matching**: Revolutionary system that connects tenants and landlords without revealing personal identities
- **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Validates credentials and preferences without exposing sensitive information
- **Secure Escrow System**: Smart contract-based payment protection for both parties
- **Encrypted Communication**: End-to-end encrypted messaging between matched parties
- **Reputation System**: Anonymous rating system that builds trust while maintaining privacy

## Key Features

üîí **Identity Protection**: Advanced encryption ensures complete anonymity during the matching process

üè† **Smart Matching Algorithm**: AI-powered system matches tenants and landlords based on encrypted preferences

üí∞ **Secure Payments**: Blockchain-based escrow system protects deposits and rental payments

üì± **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design makes privacy-preserving rental matching accessible to everyone

üåê **Decentralized**: No central authority controls your data or matching preferences

## How It Works

1. **Profile Creation**: Create anonymous profiles with encrypted preference data
2. **Matching Process**: Our algorithm finds compatible matches without revealing identities
3. **Secure Communication**: Chat with potential matches through encrypted channels
4. **Smart Contracts**: Automated agreements handle deposits, rent, and dispute resolution
5. **Identity Reveal**: Choose when and how much personal information to share

## Smart Contract

**Contract Address**: `0xAe4aE413A41b03273Ba7ae927140Ca7a924cBFfE`

The smart contract handles:
- Anonymous profile registration
- Encrypted preference matching
- Escrow services for deposits and rent
- Dispute resolution mechanisms
- Reputation score management
